This repository will mainly cover the fundamentals of Python that I've had covered throughout the program between the 2nd to 6th of February 2026 such as basic print tasks , basic loops , arrays and basic parameter tasks . This repository is mainly for my own learning purposes. 

Below are the table of contents and what to expect in the file:

module0 --- Covers the basics of printing tasks in Python . In this repository , I will be uploading the print hello_world code.

module1 --- Covers the basics of variables and strings . In this repository , I will be using my name and my age as examples of the tasks.

module2 --- Covers the basics of if-else-elif statements .

module3 --- Covers the basics of while loops .

module4 --- Covers the tasks involving the combination of module0 to module4 to create things and concepts such as floats , import math function , math.ceil() and swapcase.

module5 --- Covers the array concept , where I will be manipulating around arrays . This module also introduces sets and parameters.

module6 --- Covers the parameters in a much immersive manner , where I will be using import system function , sys.argv and also the re.findall option . I will also be using for loops in this section (carrying the concept from module3).

module7 --- Covers the parameters and for loops concept in a much immersive manner . I will also use the sys.exit() function when the sys,argv is not equal (!=) to certain number of arguments . I will also be learning about the range function.
